<h2>NASU: Madotsuki Style Version 2</h2>


<h4>High Concept:</h4>
<p>Help Madotsuki catch the falling Effect by jumping while dodging falling stars.</p>

<h4>Player Experience Goals:</h4>
<p>As an update to the first game, this game still remains a tribute to the original Yume Nikki and its side game, NASU. The players should feel frustration that comes with playing the original game of NASU as well as the delightful unsettlement that the atmosphere of Yumme Nikki brought about.</p>


<h4>Genre:</h4>
<p>This is still a catch the falling object arcade game.</p>


<h4>Game play:</h4>
<p>The player still starts the game by clicking on the game screen space with their mouse. Afterwards, the game will drop an Effect (shaped like an egg, for those who have never played Yume Nikki). Then the player has the option of clicking either the left arrow key or the right arrow key to move the character on screen (Madotsuki) left or right, respectfully. When the Effect falls upon Madotsuki's head, the Effect will disappear and a new one will spawn randomly from above. Then the player repeats moving left or right until the Effect falls to the ground, signaling Game Over. There is nothing more to this game aside from that. </p>

<p>Until this point, it is quite like the original game I turned in the first time. However, now, there's the ability to jump. In the original NASU game in Yume Nikki, the ability to jump was necessary in order to catch the falling eggplant. In this game, Madotsuki must also jump in order to catch the falling Effect. However, that isn't all. There's also stars that fall from the sky. If Madotsuki gets hit by the falling stars, she loses one point. As long as Madotsuki's score doesn't fall below 0, there isn't any more problems.</p>


<h4>Prototype goal:</h4>
<p>This time around, it was vital for me to create a game that replicated the frustation that came with playing through NASU. Therefore, it was very important that the jump function was the only way for Madotsuki to collect the Effect. I also added in omnious background music as well as challenges such as the falling stars.</p>


<h4>Features:</h4>
<p>Aside from featuring Madotsuki as the main character instead of NASU, this game also boosts of sprite animation, background sfx, background music, and game mechanic of the original games. Everything within the game (aside from coding) were taken straight from Yume Nikki game. Despite that, this game has a unique story and setting that the original games did not have. </p>


<h4>Setting/Premise:</h4>
<p>This game is set within the Yume Nikki universe. However, there is a slight difference. Instead of Madotsuki playing the game “NASU” on her NES, she is the main character of the NASU game. Instead of NASU moving around to catch eggplants in its mouth, Madotsuki must catch the falling Effects by jumping just like in NASU. Unlike in Yume Nikki, she does not gain special abilities when she catches the Effect. </p>


<h4>Story:</h4>
<p>Madotsuki, who normally spends her day daydreaming or playing on her NES, wakes up one day in the NASU game. Just like her other dreams, there is still the need to collect the Effects, even if it doesn’t give her special abilities. Therefore, as the Effects rain down from above, quite like the eggplants did to NASU, she must catch all of them before they fall to the ground. However, just like her other dreams, there are things that hinder her goal (in this case, the stars that she must dodge).</p>


<h4>Target Audience:</h4>
<p>This is mainly intended for the fans of the Yume Nikki jrpg horror game. Fans of the game will recognize not only the sprite used, but also the sfxs and gaming mechanism found in the NASU side game (although, they might find this game much easier to play than the original counterpart). Aside from the fans, anyone who enjoy a good mindless game would find this entertaining to play for few minutes at a time. Or even those who like frustrating games would probably enjoy this.</p>


<h4>Play time:</h4>
<p>Technically, as long as the player is lucky and is good at this kind of game, this game will go on forever. The speed of the character has been adjusted so that for the most part, the player will be able to catch any falling Effect. However, with the added in stars and jump functionality, it is possible that this game will last barely few minutes.</p>


<h4>Strategies:</h4>
<p>Due to the changes in the gameplay, the most important strategy is for players to keep one hand on the spacebar and another on the arrow keys. It is also important to be able to quickly calculate whether dodging the stars will cause a game over or not. That way, you can sacrifice a few score points in order to catch the Effect from falling. Aside from that, blind luck and quick reflexes never hurt.</p>


<h4>Prototype Assets:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yume Nikki was created by Kikiyama [<a href=“http://www3.nns.ne.jp/pri/tk-mto/“>x</a>] </li>
<ul>
<li>The sfxs and background music (Yume Nikki's 'End Song') were pieced together from Yume Nikki’s sound sources.</li>
<li>The sprite of the Effect was taken from Yume Nikki’s “Blonde Hair” Effect.</li>
<li>The sprite of the Knife was taken from Yume Nikki.</li>
<li>The background is the Red Maze from Yume Nikki.</li>
</ul>
<li>The sprite sheet was pieced together from flowerpalette’s sprite sheet. [<a href=“http://flowerpalette.deviantart.com/art/RPG-maker-VX-Sprite-Madotsuki-from-Yume-Nikki-517839197”>x</a>]</li>
</ul>


<h4>Prototype Closest Other Game:</h4>
<p>As mentioned many times, this is based on the side game NASU from the jrpg horror game Yume Nikki. Aside from its original source, examples from the Phaser's Basic Platformer, Gravity, Breakout, Group, and Audio were used.</p>
